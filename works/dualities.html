<h3>Multimedia performance for a dancer, 3D sound system, motion tracker, binaural headphone rendering and live electronics.  </h3>
<h4>2019</h4>


<p>This piece aims to explore the possibilities of immersive technologies in the realm of sound. Our aim is to take advantage of the possibilities of visually immersive realities and create a piece that engages mostly with the sonic component of them, namely, binaural and 3D audio, through the interaction with body gestures, creating a form of interaction that privileges the sonic over the visual through embodied listening. These interactions will ultimately pose questions about the reality of our perception: We will not ask ‘what is reality?’  but rather ‘what is sonic reality?’ </p>
