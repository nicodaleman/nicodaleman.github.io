<p>Crossover resonances is a sound sculpture that explores the interaction of reproduced sound within the spectrum and its resonances when compressed into a single reduced space. Originally the speakers were part of a single speaker tower with three different speaker cones. A crossover circuit distributes a mono signal to the different speaker cones, according to the frequency range. </p>
