<h3>Interface for quad installation based on binary continuity patterns</h3>

<div class="container-fluid">
<p>“5 Flagg” is the response of the culmination of my personal time as a student in Boston, as well as my professional evolution and my relationship with music, sound, and research. A sound installation for quadraphonic set up, the public is immersed in the same space as the performer, and the perception of the piece varies depending of the location of the spectator, since each of the four speakers carries a different audio signal. The main goal of this “instrument” is to reveal the relationships of binary numbers with musical rhythmic patters, and reflect over the concept of space in time-space. The complementary “pure” tones that fill the space of the stuttered samples create a sonic awareness of the temporal space of silence, creating continuity and unveiling new rhythmic patterns. </p>
