<p> Fourth Ear is a piece that explores embodied listening through two simultaneous techniques: Distortion Produced Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAE) and headphone binaural rendering controlled via headtracking. The objective is to take advantage of the possibilities of visually immersive realities and create a piece that engages mostly with the sonic component of them, namely, binaural and multichannel audio. The relationship with body gestures creates a form of interaction that privileges the sonic over the visual through embodied listening. </p>
