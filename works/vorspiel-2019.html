One of my main interests lays in the way acoustic space characteristics are measured and described with a more sistematic approach. Therefore I got interest in the process of reverberation measurement through impulse response (i.e. sine sweeps and noise bursts.) This led to the creation of a live performance, that was presented in the opening of the Vorspiel CTM/transmediale 2019 at Acud Macht Neu Berlin. This piece included only sine sweeps and noise bursts as the main material for the performance / composition. The piece was performed again again twice in the Sounds About gallery, this time using also the sound from the gallery and the second space through the Skype call, adding background noise and feedback effects.
