<p>Five Studies for Chaotic Oscillators is a series of audiovisual studies for an audio system of four or more channels and visual projection. The open and improvisatory nature of the studies avoid the definition of a “composition,” and should rather be considered as digital instrument. The main idea is to explore sonorities that have an unpredictable outcome based on chaotic systems and create a performance in which the performer reacts intuitively and in real time to the volatile sonic results. </p>
