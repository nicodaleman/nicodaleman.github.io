title: Five Studies for Chaotic Oscillators
---


<h3>Multichannel Audiovisual Live Performance</h3>

<h3><i>As part of the exhibition “The Changing Room”
August 1st-3rd at ACUD MACHT NEU, Berlin</i></h3>
<h4>2019</h4>




<p>Five Studies for Chaotic Oscillators is a series of audiovisual studies for an audio system of four or more channels and visual projection. The open and improvisatory nature of the studies avoid the definition of a “composition,” and should rather be considered as digital instrument. The main idea is to explore sonorities that have an unpredictable outcome based on chaotic systems and create a performance in which the performer reacts intuitively and in real time to the volatile sonic results. </p>
