DRIVE-THRU is an installative performance in the frame of the installation Radiophonic Spaces. It explores acts of transmission and reception in those in-between zones and the simultaneities of time-frames, as well as the development of technologies by flipping through different types of radio broadcasting, from radio plays to media-specific composition, to digital podcasts and broadcasting. What types of borders and areas arise from the process of broadcasting? How do different acts of "tuning in" from the side of the listener affect our understanding of geographical space?

It consists of RC cars equipped with different types of receivers and speakers, controlled by the performers in a free improvisatory manner. the cars explore the different signals in the installation of the Radiophonic Spaces and ultimately create a live collage composition, supported in the background by a fixed composition made up of commercials and radio programs related to mobile radio and car culture.
