<h3>Multichannel Sound Installation</h3>
<p>
As part of the technical team, I developed the algorithmic patch that controls the sound and movement of the pendulums, as well as the sound design of the different samples and its different modes.

<p>This is an explanation of the work:</p>

<p><i>Seconds tick by weightily; minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years: the essence of the pendulum of a grandfather clock is to measure time precisely by the repetitive beat of the pendulum. A metronome, on the other hand, as a timer in music, is able to combine variable tempos within a scale.

Jutta Ravenna’s latest work Zeiten-Pendel, explores the metronome as a sound event that oscillates between stability and instability within multiple ‘sound objects’: swinging loudspeakers in the space. To explore the physical as well as the spatial sonic effects, the size of individual metronomes has been varied and increased to architectural proportions.
