    <p>Nico Daleman is a Sound Artist, Musicologist and Sonic Researcher. He is interested in the ways in which we can gain knowledge through sonic experience. His pieces explore sonic spatial perception, psychoacoustics, dynamic systems and stochastic processes in order to (re)create, re(interpret) and (re)(imagine) real and virtual spaces. His practice is collaborative and interdisciplinary in nature and includes sound synthesis, acoustic instruments, moving images, choreography, neuroscience, data engineering and biochemistry.</p>
    <p>His pieces have been shown in Haus der Kulturen der Welt, CLB at Aufbau Haus, SoundSAbout, modular+space at Greenhouse; and he has taken part in performances at Zentrum für Kunst und Medien in Karlsruhe, Silent Green Berlin, Darmstadt 2018, ACUD MACHT NEU and Loophole. </p>
